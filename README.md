Conclusion:

We have seen through our Analysis that TF-IDF + Logistic Regression had better accuracy and the best F-1 Score for classifying reviews into positive and negative. 
We have also worked on Hyperparameter tuning techniques for Word2Vec + Random Forest Classification but accuracy remained the same.
Our future work is to work on catching the sarcasm of the reviews and deploying our model into any cloud platform.
We would also work on hyperparameter tunings to improve our accuracy.
The main challenge we have faced was massive dataset took lot of time for modelling, limited computational abilities over our laptops, Bias in our dataset.
